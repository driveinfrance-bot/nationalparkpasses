When you order a Crit'Air sticker for France, you'll be assigned one of six colour-coded categories. Each relates to your vehicle's emissions and engine type. Understanding these categories helps you know where you can drive and what restrictions apply.

## How Crit'Air Categories Work

The Crit'Air classification system ranks vehicles from least to most polluting:

**Crit'Air 0 (Green)**: Electric and hydrogen vehicles

**Crit'Air 1 (Purple)**: Modern petrol/hybrid cars (Euro 5/6)

**Crit'Air 2 (Yellow)**: Euro 5/6 diesel, Euro 4 petrol

**Crit'Air 3 (Orange)**: Older petrol/diesel models

**Crit'Air 4 (Red)**: Older diesels

**Crit'Air 5 (Grey)**: Most polluting vehicles

The lower your sticker number, the fewer restrictions you'll face when driving in French cities. Electric and ultra-low-emission vehicles (Crit'Air 0) generally have unrestricted access to most zones.

## How Your Category Is Determined

Your Crit'Air category is automatically assigned based on:

- Your vehicle's European emissions standard (Euro 1 through Euro 6)
- Your fuel type (petrol, diesel, electric, hybrid, etc.)
- Your vehicle's first registration date
- Your vehicle type (car, motorcycle, van, truck, bus)

The French government's system uses your registration details to calculate which category applies. You don't choose your category — it's determined by your vehicle's technical specifications.

## Why the Sticker Matters

Local authorities use Crit'Air categories to decide who can enter Low Emission Zones (ZFE). For example, in Paris, only vehicles with lower emission stickers may be allowed during peak hours, while high emission vehicles may be restricted or banned.

During pollution alerts, cities may temporarily restrict access to vehicles with higher Crit'Air numbers (typically 4 and 5). This means having a lower-numbered sticker gives you more flexibility and fewer travel disruptions.

## Planning Your Trip

If you're planning to drive in French cities, knowing your Crit'Air category helps you understand what restrictions might apply. Vehicles with Crit'Air 0, 1, or 2 generally have the best access, while those with 4 or 5 may face more limitations.
