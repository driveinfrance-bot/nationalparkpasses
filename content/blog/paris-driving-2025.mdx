Paris enforces Crit’Air restrictions on weekdays and during pollution alerts. Check your vehicle category before you travel and keep proof of your application while the sticker is in transit.

**Where it applies**  
The greater Paris area (ZFE) restricts older diesel vehicles the most. Zones can expand during high pollution days.

**What if I don’t have the sticker yet?**  
Carry your application receipt. Enforcement officers may accept proof of application while your vignette ships, but rules can vary.
