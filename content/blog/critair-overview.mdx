France uses Crit’Air vignettes to control access to low-emission zones. In 2025, the most notable zones include Paris, Lyon, Grenoble, and Lille. Restrictions can tighten during pollution peaks, so carrying the right sticker is essential.

**What you need**  
Your registration number, vehicle type, fuel type, and first registration date determine your Crit’Air category. You must also upload your registration document.

**Visitors and rentals**  
Foreign vehicles need Crit’Air too. Rental agreements usually do not include the sticker; apply as soon as you know your travel dates.
