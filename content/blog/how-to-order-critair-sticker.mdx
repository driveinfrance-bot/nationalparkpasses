Ordering a Crit'Air sticker is now a simple online process that all drivers heading to France should complete before travelling. Avoid long queues and potential fines by planning ahead.

## Where to Buy

The official source for Crit'Air stickers is the French government's website (certificat-air.gouv.fr). Ordering through third-party sites often costs more and may be riskier.

However, the official French government site is in French, which can be challenging for English-speaking drivers. That's where our service comes in — we provide an English-language interface that handles the entire application process for you, submitting directly to the official system.

## What You Need to Order

You'll need:

- **Your vehicle registration details**: The registration number and country of registration
- **Your vehicle's Euro emissions standard**: This is usually determined automatically from your registration details
- **A valid address for delivery**: The physical sticker will be mailed to this address
- **Your vehicle type**: Car, motorcycle, van, truck, or bus
- **Fuel type**: Petrol, diesel, electric, hybrid, etc.
- **First registration date**: When your vehicle was first registered

A temporary PDF is often supplied quickly while you wait for the physical sticker in the post. This PDF can serve as proof of application and may be accepted in some circumstances, though the physical sticker is required for full compliance.

## The Ordering Process

1. **Gather your information**: Have your vehicle registration document ready, as you'll need details from it.

2. **Enter vehicle details**: Provide your registration number, country, vehicle type, fuel type, and first registration date.

3. **Upload registration document**: You'll need to upload a copy of your vehicle registration document (PDF, JPG, or PNG).

4. **Review and submit**: Check that all information is correct before submitting.

5. **Receive confirmation**: You'll get an email confirmation, and a PDF certificate is usually available quickly.

6. **Wait for physical sticker**: The physical sticker will be mailed to your address, typically arriving within a few weeks.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Waiting until the last minute**: Order at least a few weeks before your trip to ensure the sticker arrives in time.

- **Using incorrect information**: Double-check your registration details to avoid delays or incorrect category assignment.

- **Poor quality uploads**: Make sure your registration document is clear and readable when uploading.

- **Wrong delivery address**: Ensure your delivery address is correct, as resending stickers can cause delays.
